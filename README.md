libscrapli
==========

libscrapli is a zig project that aims to provide a unified "core" for scrapli. This is obviously 
useful for the OG scrapli (python flavor) and scrapligo, but possibly for other languages/libraries 
or even for folks who would like to not have to reinvent the wheel for the "core" connection 
handling and logic but want to write their own wrapper!
