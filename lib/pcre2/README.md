pcre2-zig
=========

The PCRE2 project is kind enough to include a build.zig file which is great, however it is/was (at
time of writing) using 0.13.0 zig while libscrapli is on current master, hence this re-wrapping!
Otherwise, this is a very similar version of their provided build file, just parred down and with 
some very minor changes
